          <h2 id="brief-history">Brief History</h2>
          <p>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="_blank">The ARPANET project</a> was launched in 1969 by the <b>US Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)</b>. 
						<i>The goal was to create a network of computers that could communicate with each other across different locations and platforms</i>, and that could withstand a nuclear attack. 
						The ARPANET was the first network to use packet switching, a technique that breaks data into small units called packets, and sends them over different paths to the destination. 
						This enabled more efficient and reliable data transmission than the previous circuit switching method, which required a dedicated connection between two points.
						<br><br>
						In 1973, two researchers, <b>Vinton Cerf</b> and <b>Robert Kahn</b>, proposed a new protocol that would enable interconnection and interoperability between different networks. 
						They called it the <b>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</b>, and it was designed to provide end-to-end reliability, error recovery, and congestion control. 
						TCP also introduced the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" target="_blank">IP addresses</a>, which are unique identifiers for each host on the network. 
						TCP was later split into two separate protocols: TCP, which handles the data transmission and reliability aspects, and IP, which handles the routing and addressing aspects. Together, they form the TCP/IP protocol suite, which is the basis of the internet.

        <article id="principles" class="card">
          <h2 id="the-principles">The Principles</h2>
          <p>
						The TCP/IP model is a conceptual framework that describes how the TCP/IP protocol suite operates. It consists of four layers: the application layer, the transport layer, the internet layer, and the network access layer. 
						Each layer performs specific functions and interacts with the adjacent layers. <b><i>The application layer</i></b> is where the user applications, such as web browsers and email clients, communicate with each other. 
						<b><i>The transport layer</i></b> is where the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-tcp-and-udp/" target="_blank">TCP or UDP protocols</a> ensure reliable or fast data transmission, respectively. <b><i>The internet layer</i></b> is where the IP protocol routes the packets across different networks. 
						And <b><i>the network access layer</i></b> is where the physical and data link protocols, such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi, connect the hosts to the network media.
						<br><br>
						TCP/IP specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end communications that <i>identify how it should be broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination.</i> 
						TCP/IP requires little central management and is designed to make networks reliable with the ability to recover automatically from the failure of any device on the network.

          <h2 id="tcp-udp">TCP vs UDP</h2>
          <p>
						UDP is an alternative to TCP, offering different ways to communicate network traffic. While the former ensures reliable transfers, the latter prioritizes efficiency and speed. 
						Here are six common differences between TCP and UDP:
          </p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>The service type.</b> TCP is a connection-based protocol that requires the communicating devices to connect before transferring the actual data. 
							In comparison, UDP is a connectionless protocol that transmits information without checking whether the receiver can accept the signal.</li>
						<li>
							<b>Sequence.</b> In TCP, packets arrive in a specific order at the receiver. While in UDP, the system sends independent packets without sequence numbers.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Data retransmission.</b> TCP will resend any lost or corrupted packets, while UDP won’t.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Flow control mechanism.</b> TCP uses this technique to calibrate the data transfer speed and limit the rate when a sender transfers data. UDP doesn’t have a flow control mechanism.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Stream types.</b> TCP interprets data as bytes and transmits the IP packet to segment boundaries. In contrast, UDP reads data as messages that contain bundles.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Header length.</b> A TCP header ranges from 20-60 bytes, while UDP is eight fixed-length bytes.
						</li>
					</ul>

							<p>
								Conceptual data flow in a simple network topology of two hosts (A and B) connected by a link between their respective routers. 
								The application on each host executes read and write operations as if the processes were directly connected to each other by some kind of data pipe. 
								After establishment of this pipe, most details of the communication are hidden from each process, as the underlying principles of communication are implemented in the lower protocol layers. 
								In analogy, at the transport layer the communication appears as host-to-host, without knowledge of the application data structures and the connecting routers, while at the internetworking layer, individual network boundaries are traversed at each router.
